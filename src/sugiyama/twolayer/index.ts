 * `bottomLayer` should be rearranged to minimize crossings. When `topDown = false`
 * then `topLayer` should be rearranged, and `bottomLayer` should remain fixed.
 *
 * There are two built in two-layer operators:
 * - {@link OptOperator} - optimal crossing minimization for the layer in question
 * - {@link AggOperator} - order according to the aggregate of parent indices, fast
