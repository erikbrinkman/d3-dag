/**
 * A decross operator rearranges the nodes in a layer to minimize decrossings.
 *
 * Minimizing the number of decrossings is an NP-Complete problem, so fully
 * minimizing decrossings {@link OptOperator | optimally} can be prohibitively
 * expensive, causing javascript to crash or run forever on large dags. In
 * these instances it may be necessary to use an {@link TwoLayerOperator |
 * approximate decrossing minimization}.
 *
 * There are two built-in decrossing operators:
 * - {@link OptOperator} - fully minimizes decrossings, but may crash or run forever
 * - {@link TwoLayerOperator} - a base heuristic decrossing method considering adjacent pairs of layers at a time that can be further customized by specifying bottom up vs. top down and the specific algorithm used for the pairwise decrossing.
