Often data sets are hierarchical, but are not in a tree structure, such as genetic data.
In these instances `d3-hierarchy` may not suit your needs, which is why `d3-dag` (Directed Acyclic Graph) exists.
This module implements a data structure for manipulating DAGs.
Old versions were designed to mimic `d3-hierarchy`'s api as much as possible, newer versions have opted to use modern javascript conventions while breaking from the standard


## Examples

- [Examples with Sugiyama Layout](https://beta.observablehq.com/@erikbrinkman/d3-dag-sugiyama) - Allows you to experiment with different layouts and different datasets for the sugiyama layout.
- [Examples with Topological Layout](https://beta.observablehq.com/@erikbrinkman/d3-dag-topological) - Allows you to experiment with different layouts and different datasets for topological layouts.
- [Example with Arrows](https://observablehq.com/@erikbrinkman/d3-dag-sugiyama-with-arrows) - This example shows a simple, if inexact, way to render edge arrows with d3.
- [Examples with Arquint Layout](https://observablehq.com/@arquintl/d3-dag-arquint) - Allows you to experiment with different layouts and different datasets for the arquint layout.
- [Expandable Family Tree](https://github.com/BenPortner/js_family_tree) - An expandable family tree rendered using d3-dag.


## Installing

If you use node, `npm i d3-dag` or `yarn add d3-dag`.
Otherwise you can load it using `unpkg`:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/d3-dag@0.6.0"></script>
<script>

var dag = d3.sugiyama();

</script>
```

## Updating

Information for major changes between releases

### Updating from 0.5 to 0.6

The only breaking change happens if you happend to use this library in
typescript, and happened store an operator with its types attached (e.g. `layout:
SugiyamaOperator<NodeType, ...> = ...`). All of the individual attribute
modifier functions retained their generic signatures.

The typing for most operators changed to more easily allow adding new typed
attributes later on. `sugiyama` went from being typed like `sugiyama<NodeType,
LayeringType, DecrossType, ...>` to `sugiyama<NodeType, { layering:
LayeringType, decross: DecrosType, ... }>`. To update, you'll need to change
these declarations.

### Updating from 0.4 to 0.5

The way Sugiyama layout works was entirely rewritten. Instead of defaulting to
fitting nodes into [0, 1] in x and y, it now features a `nodeSize` accessor.
Nodes are spaced out to respect their nodeSizes, along x coordinates this is
exact, the y coordinates will respect the max height in each layer. As a result
of the this change, there is no longer a separation accessor, as the role of
that was replaced by specifying node sizes. Also, instead of sugiyama layout
just returning the laidout dag (nice for type script), it now return an object
with the dag, as well as the width and height of the final dag, including
"padding" for node sizes. The default size of dummy nodes is [0, 0]. To get
back to almost the old behavior, you can still specify a `size`. This will
rescale everything, but still keep the outside padding.

### Updating from 0.3 to 0.4

The update from 0.3 to 0.4 adds support for typescript, and makes a number of
backwards incompatible changes that arrise from the switch. Some are also the
result of cleaning up hasty early design decisions.

- Instead of having `linkData` accessors, builders `stratify` and `hierarchy`
  now have either `children`/`parentIds` or `childrenData`/`parentData` that
  combine the children/parents with the data for the link. The build link data
  into the design of the dag and removes the messy handling of the fact that
  data was tacked on.
- `points` was moved from a property on linkData to its own top level link
  property, since it's somewhat required to be there and shouldn't be mutating
  user supplied data.
- `copy`, `reverse`, and `equal` have been removed as the new structure made
  them hard to support, as DAGs are viewed more immutably now. Support could
  potentially be added back.
- Some DAG methods likes `some` and `every` have been removed because they're
  better supported by the fulent iterators returned by `idescendants`.
- In arquint, the height ratio property was switched to an accessor to be more
  inline with other methods.
- Documention has moved from the README to inline, and a github pages generated
  by typedoc.
- Switched from npm to yarn.


### Updating from 0.1 to 0.2

The update from 0.1 to 0.2 includes a few small backwards incompatible changes.

- `dratify` was renamed to `dagStratify` and `dierarchy` was renamed to `dagHierarchy` in order to pollute the d3 namespace less.
- After running a `sugiyama` layout, the `points` attribute will always exist for every links data, and it now also contains the start and end points.
- `coordSpread` was removed in favor of `coordCenter` which produces a slightly better layout in the same amount of time.
- `test/data` was moved to `examples`. This isn't technically part of the api, but it may break examples that required the old file location.
- Link data is created at dag creation time. This also isn't technically backwards compatible but might increase memory consumption.
